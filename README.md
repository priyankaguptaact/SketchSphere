# SketchSphere
Welcome to **SketchSphere**, my first project after learning DOM manipulation skills! This project is inspired by the classic Etch A Sketch toy and serves as a testament to my learning journey in web development.

## Project Overview

**SketchSphere** is a web application that allows users to create digital sketches on a canvas, mimicking the experience of an Sketch board. Users can draw by clicking and dragging the mouse, and they can clear the canvas to start fresh anytime.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: Click and drag to draw on the canvas.
- **Clear Canvas**: Reset the canvas to start a new drawing.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy drawing on any device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: Clean interface designed for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the webpage.
- **CSS**: To style the application.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and handle DOM manipulation.

## Learning Journey

Embarking on the journey of web development has been an exciting and enlightening experience. Here are some highlights of my learning process:

1. **HTML & CSS Basics**: Understanding the fundamentals of web structure and styling.
2. **JavaScript Essentials**: Learning the core concepts of JavaScript, the backbone of web interactivity.
3. **DOM Manipulation**: Gaining skills to interact with and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which led to the creation of this project.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that my web applications are accessible and functional on various devices.
